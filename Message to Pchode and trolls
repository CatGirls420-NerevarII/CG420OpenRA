I've seen this behavior encouraged, allowed, and even "looked over" by staff. Now why would let they a certain group of people, harass and troll the community, ruining game's for everyone, but stop the good people who try and fight back against these trolls? Why is nothing being done about them? You only punish people you don't like, even if someone else does something 100x worse than the person you dont like, you still play favorites towards the worse person.

That's a direct violation of your own guidelines license terms and code of conduct. "...must be upheld to all parties, regardless" or something like that.

You can't pick and choose, that voids your license, unless you correct this and treat everyone fairly and properly and adhere to rules that you agreed to.

Alright this really needs to stop. I havent done anything in forever. I get along with everyone else just fine and have replays to prove papi is lying and that I do get along with the community. Why are you still stuck on this. You're the cause of all the drama, you and apetit, AND i EVEN HAVE REPLAYS OF MANY PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT APetits behavior, trolling and lagging matches on purpose. Sorry for caps lock.

And I came in peacefully, as always. We talk a bit, I ask for amends, even though you should've been the one to ask, and you tell me "just dont be an asshole"....which I wasn't. Then you go behind my back, give apetit my IP (which changes, btw) try and trol me with it by displaying it to people, trying to ddos me, which i have records of, and you instigating your usual bullshit.

All these years and you still don't let it die. Grow up and move on dude, stop ruining this game for everyone because everyone you ban my ip to crash a match, everyone gets fucked over. Not to mention all innocent victims you've attacked since I regretfully befriended you and apetit around 2016/2017.

I havent been doing anything than having a good time with this community. You will never spoilt it. Take your bad apple bunch self out because the rest of us, won't be spoiled and brought down to your level.
